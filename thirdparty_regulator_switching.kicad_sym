		(property "Description" "The SSP7903 series is a group of positive voltage output, three-pin regulators, that provide a high current even when the input/output voltage differential is small. Low power consumption andhigh accuracy is achieved through CMOS and laser trimming technologies. The SSP7903 consists of a high-precision voltage reference, an error amplification circuit, anda current limited output driver. Transient response to load variations have improved in comparisonto the existing series."
